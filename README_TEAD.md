This repository contains the implementation of the TEAD framework, a hybrid model for intrusion detection in IoT-enabled Wireless Sensor Networks. It integrates dynamic trust evaluation, anomaly detection via KL divergence, and deep learning classification using LSTM.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `TEAD_Part2_KL_AnomalyDetection.py`  
  Computes trust scores (CLR, CWR, CFD) and applies Gaussian modeling with KL divergence to flag anomalies.

- `TEAD_Part3_LSTM_Classification.py`  
  Uses LSTM for node behavior classification based on trust metrics.

- `TEAD_Part4_Evaluation_Visualization.py`  
  Evaluates model performance using standard metrics and visualizes confusion matrix and accuracy trends.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The implementation uses the **NSL-KDD** dataset.

- You can load it directly from:  
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defcom17/NSL_KDD/master/KDDTrain+.txt`

## ðŸš€ Running in Google Colab

1. Upload all `.py` files or copy the code cells into a Colab notebook.
2. Run Part 2 to compute trust and detect anomalies.
3. Run Part 3 to train and evaluate the LSTM classifier.
4. Run Part 4 to visualize performance.
